## Here's my timeline for each step
1. Read through the document carefully (30 mins)
2. Think how to configure a project structure (30 mins)
3. Create common components like Button, Heading, Input, ... using styled-components (1 hour)
4. Create hooks which manage storage data and manage application state using Context (30 mins)
5. Design login page, validate user input and form submission (1 hour)
(I had a cors problem while calling login api and installed chrome extension which bypass it to test in my local. While testing on your side, it may require certain actions like enable cors in the server.)
6. Design list page, implement filter, crud list items, logout (1.5 hour)
